Simple project focused on verifying ray tracing algorithms using only CPU-based computation.

## Features

1、receive a simple glb/gltf input

2、use the first camera found to render target with red 

## Hardware

 intel i7-8700

## Perf

- v1.0.0 3000+ triangles take about 3 seconds to render on intel i7-8700
