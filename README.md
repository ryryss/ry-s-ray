ry is learning ray trace



Simple project focused on verifying ray tracing algorithms using only CPU-based computation.

Currently supports the following features:

1、receive a simple glb/gltf input

2、use the first camera found to render target with red 



hardware information:  i7-8700

current performance: 3000+ triangles take about 3 seconds to render
